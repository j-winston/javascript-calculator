ALGORITHM::
              


Perform operation on a pair of numbers
TODO--1. Compute addition pair
                        


// Nice to have features
- Light up operation


pressing a number the second time needs to result in a screen clear




problem: Each time an operator is pressed, the value needs to be stored and cleared
